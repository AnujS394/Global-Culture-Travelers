    <p>
      Mexico is a land of vibrant colors, rich traditions, and deep-rooted cultural expressions. Throughout the year, towns and cities across the country come alive with festivals that celebrate indigenous heritage, religious customs, music, dance, and culinary delights.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead)</h2>
    <p>
      Held on November 1st and 2nd, Día de los Muertos honors the lives of deceased loved ones with altars (ofrendas), marigold flowers, candles, sugar skulls, and family gatherings. Oaxaca and Mexico City host particularly vivid celebrations with parades, face painting, and traditional music.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Guelaguetza Festival</h2>
    <p>
      This cultural festival takes place every July in Oaxaca and celebrates the diverse indigenous groups of the region. Expect vibrant traditional costumes, folk dances, native music, and regional cuisine as different communities perform onstage to showcase their heritage.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Independence Day (El Grito)</h2>
    <p>
      Celebrated on the night of September 15th, El Grito commemorates Mexico's fight for independence from Spain. Locals gather in town squares, waving flags, chanting "¡Viva México!", and enjoying fireworks, mariachi music, and traditional food.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Carnaval in Veracruz & Mazatlán</h2>
    <p>
      One of Mexico's most exciting pre-Lenten celebrations, Carnaval combines parades, music, dancing, and elaborate costumes. Mazatlán’s coastal setting makes for a party atmosphere, while Veracruz infuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms into its celebration.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Las Posadas</h2>
    <p>
      A nine-day celebration from December 16–24, Las Posadas reenacts Mary and Joseph’s journey to Bethlehem. Communities gather each night for candlelight processions, singing, breaking piñatas, and enjoying tamales and ponche (fruit punch).
    </p>

    <h2>Experience It All</h2>
    <p>
      No matter when you visit, Mexico offers rich cultural immersion through its festivals. These events are more than entertainment — they are a living expression of history, community, and identity. Attending them will leave you with lasting memories and a deeper appreciation for Mexican heritage.
