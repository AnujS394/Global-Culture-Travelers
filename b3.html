    <p>
      Planning a two-week backpacking adventure? Packing light doesn't mean sacrificing comfort or essentials.
      Here are top packing tips from seasoned travelers to help you pack smart, stay mobile, and enjoy every moment of your journey.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Choose the Right Backpack</h2>
    <p>
      A 40–50 liter backpack is ideal for most trips. Make sure it’s lightweight, has good back support,
      multiple compartments, and rain resistance. Try it on before buying to ensure a good fit.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use Packing Cubes</h2>
    <p>
      Packing cubes help organize clothing by category and compress them to save space.
      Color code them or label them for quick access.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Follow the Rule of 3s</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 shirts</li>
      <li>3 pairs of underwear</li>
      <li>3 pairs of socks</li>
      <li>1 pair of pants + 1 shorts</li>
      <li>1 jacket/sweater for layering</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Prioritize Multi-use Items</h2>
    <p>
      Choose clothing and gear that can serve multiple purposes,
      such as a scarf that doubles as a blanket, or pants that zip off into shorts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Travel-size Toiletries</h2>
    <p>
      Refill small containers with your favorite products.
      Don’t forget items like dry shampoo, laundry soap sheets, sunscreen, and a microfiber towel.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Keep Essentials Handy</h2>
    <p>
      Store your passport, tickets, wallet, phone, and charger in an easily accessible daypack or front pocket.
      Keep backups of documents digitally and in a secure pouch.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Be Ready for the Unexpected</h2>
    <p>
      Always carry a compact rain poncho, a basic first-aid kit,
      and a flashlight or headlamp. These small items can be lifesavers on the road.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>
      The key to successful backpacking is to travel light but smart.
      Stick to essentials, organize your gear, and adapt your list to your destination’s climate and activities.
      The lighter your pack, the freer your journey.
